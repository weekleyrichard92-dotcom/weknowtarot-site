# 📚 WE KNOW TAROT - DOCUMENTATION

> Complete strategic planning for building the platform

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**We Know Tarot** is evolving from a tarot reading website into **the Shopify of Tarot** - a complete platform that enables creators to build, monetize, and scale their tarot businesses.

**The "Picks and Shovels" Strategy:** Instead of competing to sell tarot decks, we sell the TOOLS to create and sell tarot decks. Like Levi Strauss selling jeans during the gold rush, we profit by enabling thousands of creators.
